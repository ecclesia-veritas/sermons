On Truth
========

Tell the truth.  As best as you know how, speak only truth in the words you use.  Speaking non-truths or being deceptive tears at the very fabric of your being.  It shows a great deal of disrespect to those to whom you are speaking when your words to not carry the truth that you know in your heart.

It is easy to simply ask you to tell the truth, but it might be tempting to ignore this advice as naive and simplistic.  Ignoring this advice would be done to your detriment though, as it is for your own good.

Why is honesty the best policy?
